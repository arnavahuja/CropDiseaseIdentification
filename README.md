# Crop Disease Identification

## Introduction
As a deep learning enthusiast, this project was undertaken to explore the intricacies of image classification and make it better. This project aims to increase the accuracy in crop disease identification by creating a new custom defined model inspired from the resnet as well as the inception net structure.

## Approach/Methodology Used
* The resnet structure was initially used for crop disease identification as it is a celebrated structure for image classification tasks.
* We then made a custom model, inspired from the resnet architecture as well as the inception architecture using both of them to our advantage.

## Results
* We were pleased to see that our new custom model gave an accuracy of 98.16% which was more than the one given by the original resnet model (97.5%)
* We believe the this model can be used for other tasks as well and give a great accuracy too.
